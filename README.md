The small project Solar Pump System is a sustainable solution for irrigation and water pumping. It utilizes solar energy as a source of power instead of traditional electrical or diesel methods. The system is designed to be cost-effective, eco-friendly and easy to maintain. It consists of a solar panel, a pump controller, and a pump motor. The solar panel captures the energy from the sun and converts it into electrical energy. The pump controller regulates the power to the pump motor and ensures efficient operation. The pump motor then pumps water from a source to the desired location for irrigation or other uses. This project aims to provide a sustainable alternative for small scale farmers and rural communities who rely on water for their livelihood.
